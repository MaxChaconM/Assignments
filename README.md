# My_Tool

This tool will help riggers in their workflow, creating custom chains, controllers, deformers, etc. Allowing the rigger to create props or characters much faster. This will be the basis of an autorig tool in the future! THe idea is to have different setups for vehicles, animals, biped characters and much more!
